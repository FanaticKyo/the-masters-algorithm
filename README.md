# the_masters_algorithm
A web scraper built with Python and Beautiful Soup for collecting data of the Top 75 Masters in Engineering in the US, according the USNews rankings. 

The features collected are as follows:
* Rank
* School Name
* Location
* Application deadline for international applicants
* Application fee for international applicants
* Size of full-time faculty
* Size of full-time student body
* Full-time tuition
* Link for each school's engineering department

Feel free to take a look at the code and tweak it to fit your own needs. Beautiful Soup provides a very neat and intuitive way of parsing HTML files. 

The scraper was built using Python 3, so make sure you have that installed on your machine before running the script.
